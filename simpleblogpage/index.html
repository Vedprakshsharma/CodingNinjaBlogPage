    </div>
    <div><p>HTML is short for Hyper TextMarkup Language.Basically,it' the "code" behind every webpage-even this one.If you're just beginning to learn HTML,Let us tell you that it's a fairly easy task. HTML 
        without styling,can't do anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table,or creating frames-but it handy as it helps you structure the content correctly,which is important when you sit down to add
    style to your HTML . </p></div>

     <div><p>
       However simple this might seem ,it is a mighty useful tool when it comes to full-fledged web development.Various tools easily eliminates the HTML coding from your work process-but if you want to be in
       full control of your web-page,you'll need to have some command over HTML. 
     </p>
    <P>Through this article, we aim to give you the essential HTML be building blocks that'll help you get up and running.Reading this, you'll be able to understand an HTML source code and even modify it for your
        own good!  </P></div>
       <h1>Steo One-TAGS</h1>
       <img src="logo5.png" hight ="45%" width="70%">
       <div><p>
        Tags are what you'll see the most when you look at any HTML source code.A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any  item on your HTML document.Tags tell magic is to be done on the content 
        enclosed by them.
       </p>
    <p>Let's look at two types of tags :
        <ol type="1">
            <li>&lt;tags-example-1&gt;I need a closing tag&lt;/tags-example-1&gt;
            </li>
            <li>&lt;tags-example-2&gt;I don't need a cloding tag.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In the first example ,the sentence is wrapped by two tags.The first one is called the closing tag. Everything in between is affected by the properties of the tag. Very 
             commonly used examples of such tags are &lt;html&gt;,&lt;head&gt;,&lt;body&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;,etc. </p>
    </p></div>
    <h1>Step two-HTML,HEAD,and BODY: The Three pillers of your documents</h1>
    <img src="logo6.png"higtht="60%"width="50%">
    <div><p>These tags are essential for any HTML document. They parcel out the significant parts of your HTML Code. </p>
        <ul type ="solid circle">
            <li>&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;is placed below your &lt;Head&gt;tag ,and everything that you want to be displayed on your screen comes under this tag.Text,images,links,and pretty much anything you can see in
                your browser live inside this tag
            </li><li>&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt; wraps your entire code . Everything else in your HTML document needs to come inside these tags. </li>
            <li>&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;includes things like title ,style,and scripts.Head is usually present at the top(hah!),just inside the&lt;/HTML&gt;tags </li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Step three-A few tags that'll make your page pretty</h1>
<p>Now that you know to set up the Skeleton of your document,let's proceed with the things your &lt;BODY&gt;tag and do some magic!</p>
<p>Some basic text formatting tags:</p>
<ul><li>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; makes your text look<b>bold</b></li>
<li>&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;makes you write in cursive</li>
<li>&lt;u&gt;&lt;u&gt;<u>underlines</u>what you just wrote</li></ul>
<p>For example, this piece of code</p></div>
<div><img src="logo7.png">
<p>Should produce something like this on your browser :Don't fret too much about the &lt;br/&gt;. It's just for breaking the line so that you can start from the next line .Enter key does little when it comes to changing
    line in your HTML document. </p>
<img src="logo8.png"></div>
<div><h1>Tags to help you structur your content :</h1>
<ul type="solid circle">
    <li>&lt;br/&gt; breaks the line ,making you continue to next line .</li>
    <li>&lt;p&gt; stands for paragraph.It divides your content into paragraphs</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Note: You need to use these tags as space and enter keys do very little when it comes to formatting content inside an HTML docuent</i></p></div>
<h1>Heading Tags: </h1>
<p>HTML provides you with six tags from &lt;H1&gt;&lt;/H1&gt; to &lt;H6&gt;&lt;H6&gt; to help you create different sized headers quickly .</p>
<img src="logo9.png"hight="50%",width="50%">
<h1>Inserting an Image:</h1>
<p>All that's good ,but what fun without images on the webpage? Don't worry,&lt;IMG/&gt;to the rescue! The image tag has a mandatory atteribute called "source".Basically,it tells the browser where it should look 
    for the image. The syntax goes something like:
  </p><p><i>&lt; img src="path_to_your_image"/&gt;</i></p>
  <p>Furthermore , it also has has atteributes like height and width that let you specify the height and width you want your image to take.</p>
  <h1>Lists:</h1>
  <div>
    <p>HTML has two types of lists - ordered and unorder . Each item of your list has to be enclosed in tag. The syntax for creating a list is fairly simple. </p>
    <p>Suppose you want to create a list like:</p>
    <ul type="solid circle">
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following code will easily do the job for you:</p>
    <img src="logo10.png">  
</div>
<div>
    <p>This ,by the way ,was an example of an unordered list. For an ordered list,all you need to do is replace &lt;ul&gt; with &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;/ul&gt; with &lt;/ol&gt;</p>
     <p>Let's see what the following code does:</p>
     <img src="logo11.png">
     <img src="logo12.png">
     <p>All of these tags ,when arranged coherent,will provide you with provide you with a simple webpage consisting of images ,heading,and lists. Further,there are various tags that  HTML Supports,and we thoroughly
         recommend you to check them out and play them! </p>
     <h1>In Conclusion</h1>
     <p>You now know enough to skim through and underStand any part of HTML code . We request you to go ahead and try  Skimming through the source code of any website (you'll find some tags you don't
            know,but that's how you learn!)  </p>
